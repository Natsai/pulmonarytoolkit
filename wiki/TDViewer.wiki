#summary A Matlab application for viewing 2D and 3D medical imaging data


= TDViewer =

TDViewer is a standalone application for visualising 3D or 2D data slice-by-slice. 

= Running TDViewer =

To visualise a 3D volume contained in the matrix my_image, run:
{{{
    TDViewer(my_image);
}}}
`my_image` can also be a TDImage or TDDicomImage class. This is preferable, because then TDViewer will respect the voxel size and automatically display a title based on the patient name.

You may first need to add the PTK paths
{{{
    TDAddPtkPaths;
}}}

You can specify an image type to control how the image is displayed:
{{{
    TDViewer(my_image, image_type);
}}}
Possible values of image_type are:

 * `TDImageType.Grayscale` - visualise a greyscale image (use for CT and MRI data)
 * `TDImageType.Colormap`  - visualise using the Lines colourmap. Each voxel represents a colour, e.g. 1 = blue, 2 = green, 3 = red etc.
 * `TDImageType.Scaled`       - visualise in shades of red (positive values) or blue (negative values), scaling the image so that the smallest value is black and the highest value is red.

To view data from DICOM files, load them into a TDImage and then display this:
{{{
    dicom_image = TDLoadImageFromDicomFiles(path, filenames);
    TDViewer(dicom_image);
}}}
A similar approach applies to mhd/raw files:
{{{
    my_image = TDLoad3DRawAndMetaFiles(path, filenames, uid);
    TDViewer(my_image);
}}}
Note you must specify an image uid, because this is not specified in the metaheader.
